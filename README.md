This project is called Nom-Add and it was the 2nd project that I made during my Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly Singapore.

I created this app to have a centralised site for anyone to bookmark FnB outlets for future reference. The idea came after finding it troublesome to find a centralised place to note down eateries mentioned in listicles or videos online that I would like to visit at a later date. It was also partially inspired by Where The F### Should I Go To Eat? (https://wtfsigte.com/)

I utilised Node.JS, MongoDB/Mongoose, Javascript, Pug and CSS. I used @sahat 's Hackathon Starter (https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter) as a base, with Google Maps API and data seeded from Zomato to supplement the map and restaurant data.

The Hackathon Starter really useful in creating local and social media sign-in strategies, and it is a good guide for beginners to learn about CRUD.
